# Odin Recipes Project

This is a project assignment from "The Odin Project".

This repository is to practice my knowledge of HTML and CSS. In this project I'm going to build a basic recipe website.

This website will have a main index.html file, which will link to a few recipes. The styling will come eventually; so this website will only consist of HTML.

Thoughts/Reflection:

This is also for me to teach how to use SSH keys, and to commit/push using linux on my local machine.
